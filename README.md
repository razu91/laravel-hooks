# Laravel Hooks

The filter and action system in Laravel is inspired by WordPress hooks

## About

<b>Actions</b> are code snippets that run at specific points in your program. They don't return any value but provide a way to hook into your existing code without causing interference.

<b>Filters</b> are designed to alter data. They always return a value, typically the modified version of the first parameter, which is the default return behavior.

    By calling <b>do_action</b>, you execute all functions linked to the specified <b>$tag</b>, passing any optional arguments to each function. This allows custom code to be run at specific points within the application.
